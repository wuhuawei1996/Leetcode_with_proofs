    "## Two's Complement \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Two's complement is a method used by computers to represent both positive and negative integers in binary. It's the most common way of handling signed integers because it simplifies arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison. Here's an explanation of what it means:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Two's Complement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Positive Numbers:\n",
    "- Positive integers are represented in binary as usual. For example:\n",
    "    - `5` in an 8-bit system: `00000101`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Negative Numbers:\n",
    "- Negative integers are represented in a special way to make arithmetic operations consistent.\n",
    "- The most significant bit (MSB, the leftmost bit) acts as the sign bit:\n",
    "    - `0` for positive numbers.\n",
    "    - `1` for negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Converting a Positive Number to Negative (Two's Complement Representation):\n",
    "- Invert all the bits of the number (flip `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).\n",
    "- Add `1` to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, for any integer `x`, `-x = ~x + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Represent `-5` in an 8-bit system:\n",
    "- Start with `5`: `00000101`\n",
    "- Invert the bits: `11111010`\n",
    "- Add 1: `11111011`\n",
    "- So, `-5` is represented as `11111011` in two's complement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Range of Values in Two's Complement:\n",
    "- For an `n`-bit system:\n",
    "    - Minimum value: `-2^(n-1)`\n",
    "    - Maximum value: `2^(n-1) - 1`\n",
    "- Example for 8 bits:\n",
    "    - Range: `-128` to `127`"

    "## Basic Bitwise Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bitwise AND (`&`)\n",
    "Performs a bitwise AND operation. It compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if both corresponding bits are `1`, otherwise it returns `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "b = 3  # Binary: 0011\n",
    "result = a & b  # Binary: 0101 & 0011 = 0001\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Bitwise OR (`|`)\n",
    "Performs a bitwise OR operation. It compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if at least one of the corresponding bits is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "b = 3  # Binary: 0011\n",
    "result = a | b  # Binary: 0101 | 0011 = 0111\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bitwise XOR (`^`)\n",
    "Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation. It compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if the bits are different, otherwise `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "for any integer `a`, `b`, and `c`, We have the following properties:\n",
    "- `a ^ 0 = a`\n",
    "- `a ^ a = 0`\n",
    "- `(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence for any integers `a` and `b`, we have `a ^ b ^ b = a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "b = 3  # Binary: 0011\n",
    "result = a ^ b  # Binary: 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Bitwise NOT (`~`)\n",
    "Performs a bitwise NOT operation. It flips all the bits of the number (`0` becomes `1`, and `1` becomes `0`). In Python, integers are represented using two's complement, so the result of `~x` is `-(x + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "result = ~a  # Binary: ~0101 = -(0101 + 1) = -6\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: -6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Left Shift (`<<`)\n",
    "Shifts the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions. New bits on the right are filled with `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`a << b` is equivalent to <code>a * 2<sup>b</sup></code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "result = a << 2  # Binary: 0101 << 2 = 10100\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Right Shift (`>>`)\n",
    "Shifts the bits of the number to the right by the specified number of positions. New bits depend on the sign of the number: for positive numbers, `0` is added on the left, while for negative numbers, `1` is added on the left (arithmetic shift).\n",
    "\n",
    "`a >> b` is equivalent to <code>a // 2<sup>b</sup></code>, where `//` is floor division, which performs rounding down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:** The `int()` function represents extracting the integer part, which results in rounding toward zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "result = a >> 2  # Binary: 0101 >> 2 = 0001\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Precedence\n",
    "The operator precedence is as follows: arithmetic operators > shift operators > bitwise logical operators."

    "## Classical Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bit Masking\n",
    "Using bitwise operators, you can isolate or manipulate specific bits of a number. This is commonly used for low-level programming tasks.\n",

    "a = 29  # Binary: 11101\n",
    "mask = 0b111  # Binary: 000111\n",
    "result = a & mask  # Binary: 11101 & 000111 = 000101\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Checking if a Bit is Set\n",
    "To check if a specific bit is set (1) in a number, use the AND operation with a bit mask.\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "mask = 0b010  # Binary: 0010\n",
    "result = a & mask  # Binary: 0101 & 0010 = 0010\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Setting a Bit\n",
    "You can set a specific bit to `1` using the OR operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Set the 3rd bit (from the right) of a number\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "mask = 0b100  # Binary: 0100\n",
    "result = a | mask  # Binary: 0101 | 0100 = 1101\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 13\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Clearing a Bit\n",
    "You can clear (set to `0`) a specific bit using the AND operation with the NOT of a mask.\n",
    "\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5  # Binary: 0101\n",
    "mask = 0b010  # Binary: 0010\n",

    "result = a ^ mask  # Binary: 0101 ^ 0010 = 0111\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Getting the Remainder modulo a Power of 2\n",
    "For any integer `a` and power of 2 `b`, the remainder of `a` modulo `b` is equivalent to `a & (b - 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Calculate `a % 8` using bitwise operations\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 29\n",
    "result = a & 0b1000  # 29 & 7 = 5\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Getting the Leftmost Bit\n",
    "To get the position of the leftmost bit set to `1` in a number, you can use the following formula: `1 << (int(log2(a)))`.\n",
