Therefore, we can try to find a path from position $0$ to position $n-1$ as follows: starting from position $n-2$, we search $n-2$ backward for the first (when viewed in reverse) position $j$ that can jump to $n-1$ in one step. According to the above observation, a path from position $0$ to position $n-1$ exists if and only if there is a path from position $0$ to position $j$. If we cannot find such a position $j$, then there is no path from position $0$ to position $n-1$; however, if we can find it, then the problem size is reduced (the index moves forward) and we can treat $j$ as the new goal."
