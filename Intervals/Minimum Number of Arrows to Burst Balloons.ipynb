    "# Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons\n",
    "$\\quad$ There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where $points[i] = [x_{start}, x_{end}]$ denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between $x_{start}$ and $x_{end}$. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with $x_{start} and $x_{end}$ is burst by an arrow shot at $x$ if $x_{start}\\le x\\le x_{end}$. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.\n",
