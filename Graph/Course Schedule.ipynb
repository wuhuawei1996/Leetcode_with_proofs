    "\n",
    "Consider a directed graph `(G,E)` where the nodes represent all the courses. There is a directed edge from course `a` to course `b` (not necessarily different) if and only if `a` is a prerequisite for `b`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define a type of order: two nodes `a` and `b` (not necessarily different) are said to have a relationship `a < b` if there exists a directed path from `a` to `b`. It is evident that this relationship is transitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that this relationship generally does not satisfy reflexivity. In fact, if there is an arrow from `a` to `b` and an arrow from `b` to `a`, then we simultaneously have `a < b` and `b < a`, but `b != a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this order, our goal is to determine whether there exists a permutation (usually not unique) of all the nodes <code>v<sub>1</sub>, ... ,v<sub>n</sub></code> such that if <code>v<sub>i</sub> &lt; v<sub>j</sub></code>, then `i < j`. If such a permutation is possible, then this relationship is called a topological order. \n",
    "\n",
    "We claim that the following two conditions are equivalent:\n",
    "1. The relationship `<` is a topological order;\n",
    "2. For any node `a`, `a < a` does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that condition 2 is equivalent to saying that there are no cycles in the directed graph `(G,E)`. Therefore, determining whether a directed graph defines a topological order is equivalent to checking whether the graph contains a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that condition 2 implies that the relationship `<` is reflexive. Indeed,\n",
    "assume that there exist two distinct nodes `a` and `b` such that `a <= b` and `b <= a`. Since there are different nodes, we have `a < b` and `b < a`. By the transitivity, we have `a < a`, which contradicts the assumption. However, conversely, reflexivity cannot imply condition 2, as it cannot exclude the existence of isolated nodes with self-loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now prove our claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "`1 => 2`: Assume first that this relationship is a topological order. Then there exists a permutation (usually not unique) of all the nodes <code>v<sub>1</sub>, ... ,v<sub>n</sub></code> such that if <code>v<sub>i</sub> &lt; v<sub>j</sub></code>, then `i < j`. If `a < a` holds, then in the sequence, there are at least two `a`, which contradicts the fact that the sequence is a permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`2 => 1`: We perform induction on the number of nodes in `|G|=n`. Assume that the conclusion holds for any directed graph with `n-1` nodes. We claim that there exists a node `c` such that for any node `b`, `b < c` does not hold. Suppose such a node does not exist. Starting from any node <code>x<sub>0</sub></code>, by assumption, there exists a node <code>x<sub>1</sub></code> such that <code>x<sub>1</sub> &lt; x<sub>0</sub></code>. Again, by assumption, there exists a node <code>x<sub>2</sub></code> such that <code>x<sub>2</sub> &lt; x<sub>1</sub></code>. Continuing in this way, we obtain an infinite sequence <code>..., x<sub>n</sub>, ..., x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>0</sub></code> such that <code>x<sub>i+1</sub> &lt; x<sub>i</sub></code> for any `i >= 0`. Since `a < a` does not hold for any node `a`, all nodes in this sequence are distinct. However, since the graph has only a finite number of nodes, this is impossible. Therefore, there exists a node `c` such that for any node `b`, `b < c` does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we remove the node `c` from the graph `G`, resulting in a directed subgraph `G'`. By the induction hypothesis, `G'` defines a topological order, i.e., there exists a permutation <code>v<sub>1</sub>, ... ,v<sub>n-1</sub></code> of all the nodes of `G'` such that if <code>v<sub>i</sub> &lt; v<sub>j</sub></code>, then `i < j`. We now put `c` at the beginning of this sequence. For any node `a` in `G` with `c < a`, it must be in `G'`, since `a < a` does not hold. Therefore, the sequence <code>c, v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>n-1</sub></code> is a topological order of `G`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the proof of the claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the proof of `2 => 1` above actually provides a constructive method for obtaining a topological order."
