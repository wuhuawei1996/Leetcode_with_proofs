    "A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string `startGene` to a gene string `endGene` where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, `\"AACCGGTT\" --> \"AACCGGTA\"` is one mutation.\n",

    "There is also a gene bank `bank` that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in `bank` to make it a valid gene string.\n",
