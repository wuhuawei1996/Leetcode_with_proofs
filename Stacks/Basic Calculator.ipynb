    "$\\quad$ The expression corresponding to $s$, when expanded, can be simplified into the following form:\n",
    "$$sign_0 * a_0 + sign_1 * a_1 + sign_2 * a_2 + ... + sign_{n-1} * a_{n-1} + sign_n * a_n,$$\n",
    "where $a_i\\ge 0$ and $sign_i\\in\\{1, -1\\}$ for any $0\\le i\\le n$. Each $a_i$ can be obtained by reading the digits one by one. The challenge lies in how to compute these signs $sign_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Firstly, if $a_i$ is not enclosed within any parentheses (i.e., it is at the outermost level of the expression), then $sign_i$ is essentially the last \"+\" or \"-\" encountered before encountering $a_i$. This suggests that we should maintain a variable $sign$ to track the last \"+\" or \"-\" encountered. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ If $a_i$ is enclosed by exactly one layer of parentheses, then $sign_i$ is the product of the sign before \"(\" and the last sign encountered before $a_i$. Moreover, the sign before the parentheses depends on the most recent \"+\" or \"-\" encountered before the \"(\". For example, in the expanded form of the expression \"1-(-2+3)\", the sign of $2$ is $-1\\cdot -1 =1$, while the sign of $3$ is $-1\\cdot 1 =-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ If $a_i$ is enclosed by exactly two layers of parentheses, then $sign_i$ is the product of the sign before the outermost \"(\", the sign before the second layer \"(\", and the last sign encountered before $a_i$. For example, in the expanded form of the expression \"1-(-2-(3-4))\", the sign of $3$ is $-1\\cdot -1\\cdot 1 =1$, while the sign of $4$ is $-1\\cdot -1\\cdot -1 =-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ This suggests that, in addition to maintaining the variable $sign$, we should also maintain a stack to record the sign associated with each layer of parentheses. The top element of the stack should be popped when encountering a \")\", as this indicates a return to the previous layer."
