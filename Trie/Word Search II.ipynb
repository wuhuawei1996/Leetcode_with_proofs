    "## Optimization Ideas for the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dynamic Trie Pruning\n",
    "- **Current Behavior**:\n",
    "  - When a word is found, its end marker (`\"#\"`) is removed from the Trie.\n",
    "  - Additionally, if a Trie node becomes empty after backtracking, it is deleted using `parent.pop(char)`.\n",
    "- **Why It's Efficient**:\n",
    "  - Dynamically reduces the search space of the Trie during execution.\n",
    "  - Prevents revisiting already found words, saving unnecessary computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Avoid Redundant String Operations\n",
    "- **Current Behavior**:\n",
    "  - `path.append(char)` and `\"\".join(path)` are used to construct the matched word.\n",
    "- **Optimization Idea**:\n",
    "  - Instead of appending characters to a list and joining them later, track the indices of the current word in the grid. This avoids creating intermediate strings during recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Mark Visited Cells Efficiently\n",
    "- **Current Behavior**:\n",
    "  - The visited cell is marked by replacing the character in `board[i][j]` with `\"#\"`, and it is restored after backtracking.\n",
    "- **Optimization Idea**:\n",
    "  - Use a separate `visited` set or a bitmask to track visited cells, avoiding in-place modifications to `board`. This can improve memory locality and avoid potential side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Heuristic Sorting\n",
    "- **Optimization Idea**:\n",
    "  - Sort words or Trie nodes by their frequency or length before the search starts.\n",
    "  - This can prioritize matching shorter or more frequent words, which leads to faster Trie pruning and early termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Reduce Neighbor Search Overhead\n",
    "- **Current Behavior**:\n",
    "  - For every cell, all four neighbors are checked using `0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n`.\n",
    "- **Optimization Idea**:\n",
    "  - Precompute valid neighbor coordinates for the grid or avoid unnecessary boundary checks with better condition handling. This reduces redundant comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Batch Word Search for Large Grids\n",
    "- **Optimization Idea**:\n",
    "  - For very large grids, segment the search space into smaller regions, processing parts of the board incrementally.\n",
    "  - This helps minimize Trie depth for each segment and reduces memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Explanation of Current Codeâ€™s Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Trie Construction\n",
    "- Efficiently stores all words in a prefix tree, which allows quick lookup for valid prefixes and words.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(W \\cdot L)\\), where \\(W\\) is the number of words, and \\(L\\) is the average word length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Backtracking with Trie\n",
    "- Each cell in the grid is a starting point for recursive exploration.\n",
    "- By only exploring valid paths in the Trie (`if board[x][y] in node`), unnecessary branches are pruned early.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dynamic Word Removal\n",
    "- Found words are dynamically removed from the Trie (`node.pop(\"#\")`), which significantly reduces the search space during subsequent searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. In-Place Board Modification\n",
    "- Marking cells with `\"#\"` avoids using an additional data structure to track visited cells.\n",
    "- This keeps space usage minimal, though it modifies the input grid.\n",
    "\n",
