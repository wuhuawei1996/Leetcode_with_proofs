    "# Trie\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ A Trie (pronounced \"try\") is a tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve strings, especially when dealing with prefix-based operations. Each node in the trie represents a common prefix, and the characters along the path form the complete string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics of a Trie\n",
    "1. Node Structure:\n",
    "- Each node can have multiple children.\n",
    "- Each edge represents a character.\n",
    "- A node can store whether it marks the end of a string.\n",
    "2. Root Node:\n",
    "- The root node is typically empty and does not store any character.\n",
    "3. Search Time Complexity:\n",
    "- For a string `s`, insertion and search take `O(length of s)`.\n",
    "- This is much faster than linear search, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "4. Applications:\n",
    "- Prefix matching: Check if a prefix exists.\n",
    "- Word frequency counting: Store and retrieve counts of words.\n",
    "- Autocomplete: Suggest words based on prefixes.\n",
    "- Spell checking: Efficiently validate dictionary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trie Structure\n",
    "$\\quad$ For example, building a Trie with the words cat, car, and cart:\n",
    "```SCSS\n",
    "       (root)\n",
    "      /    \\\n",
    "    c        ...\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  a   ...\n",
    " / \\\n",
    "t   r\n",
    "|    \\\n",
    "(end)  t\n",
    "      (end)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trie Operations\n",
    "1. Insert:\n",
    "- Start from the root node and add each character of the word as a new child node if it doesn’t already exist.\n",
    "- Mark the node of the last character as the end of the word.\n",
    "2. Search:\n",
    "- Start from the root node and follow the path corresponding to the characters of the word.\n",
    "- If any character is missing, the word doesn’t exist.\n",
    "3. Prefix Matching (startsWith):\n",
    "- Similar to search but only checks if the prefix exists in the Trie, without requiring it to be a complete word.\n",
    "4. Delete:\n",
    "- Deletion is more complex because nodes may have dependencies due to shared prefixes."
