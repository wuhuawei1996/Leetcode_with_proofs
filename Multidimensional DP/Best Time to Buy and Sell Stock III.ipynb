    "## Method 1: Left-Right Partition\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ A classic approach is to split all transactions into two segments:\n",
    "1. The first transaction only occurs in the “left” part of the range (from day `0` to day `i`).\n",
    "2. The second transaction only occurs in the remaining “right” part (from day `i+1` to the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for every possible partition point `i`:\n",
    "1. Calculate the maximum profit from at most one transaction in the left segment (days `0` to `i`), denoted as `leftProfit[i]`.\n",
    "2. Calculate the maximum profit from at most one transaction in the right segment (days `i+1` to the end), denoted as `rightProfit[i+1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ When you iterate over all possible `i`, `leftProfit[i] + rightProfit[i+1]` represents the total profit if the first transaction ends before or on day `i` and the second one starts afterward. The maximum sum across all `i` is the maximum total profit achievable with at most two transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ As for how to calculate `leftProfit` and `rightProfit`, we can use the same approach as in the previous problem \"Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\"."
