    "# Snakes and Ladders\n",
    "You are given an `n x n` integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from `1` to <code>n<sup>2</sup></code> in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. `board[n - 1][0]`) and alternating direction each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start on square `1` of the board. In each move, starting from square `curr`, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a destination square next with a label in the range <code>[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n<sup>2</sup>)]</code>.\n",
    "    - This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.\n",
    "- If `next` has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.\n",
    "- The game ends when you reach the square <code>n<sup>2</sup></code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and <code>n<sup>2</sup></code> are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per dice roll. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the least number of dice rolls required to reach the square <code>n<sup>2</sup></code>. If it is not possible to reach the square, return `-1`."

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).\n",
    "- You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.\n",
    "- You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.\n",
    "- You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.\n",
    "- You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game. This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]\n",
